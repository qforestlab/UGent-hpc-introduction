# UGent-hpc-introduction
This repository is not meant as a tutorial itself but to help you navigate the journey of using a hpc cluster. Below we described the necessary steps to work with the hpc cluster for UGent and link to the university pages with relevant information. If you are curious what a hpc cluster is and whether it would be useful for your research vist https://docs.hpc.ugent.be/Windows/introduction/

## Create a vsc account
The first step to working with the hpc cluster is through a vsc account (https://docs.hpc.ugent.be/Windows/account/), you can also generate a public and private key-pair to ensure safe access to the cluster but this is not required if you exclusively use the web-interface. 

## Get acces to the cluster 
Follow the steps described here to connect to the ugent cluster (https://docs.hpc.ugent.be/Windows/connecting/). Once you can connect to one cluster you can also connect to any other cluster of the Flemish universities, you can access details on all these clusters here (https://docs.vscentrum.be/compute/infrastructure.html).

## useful links
The hpc cluster works via a linux interface so it might be useful to spend some time on getting to know a basis of linux, you can find some documentation on that here (https://docs.hpc.ugent.be/Windows/linux-tutorial/) as well as anywhere on the internet ;)
